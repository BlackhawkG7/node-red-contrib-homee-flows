# Node-RED Flows for homee in homee

This repository contains some sample flows for the
[node-red-contrib-homee](https://github.com/stfnhmplr/node-red-contrib-homee) plugin.

You can import the flows into your Node-RED instance. Instructions for importing can be found
[here](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/workspace/import-export)

When importing the flows, the configuration node must then be deleted and replaced by your own
virtual homee in each of the imported virtual devices.
